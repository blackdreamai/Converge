## Overview

**Converge** is a high-level, declarative programming language designed specifically for developing and implementing neuromorphic computing systems. It abstracts away the complexities of the underlying hardware, allowing developers to focus on creating efficient and effective neuromorphic applications.

## Key Features

1. **Neural Abstraction**: Converge provides an intuitive and straightforward way to define, configure, and interact with spiking neural networks. Developers can express large-scale neuromorphic systems in a high-level, abstract manner, while the language ensures the appropriate low-level translations to leverage the capabilities of neuromorphic hardware.

2. **Neuromorphic Hardware Optimization**: Converge integrates hardware-specific optimizations, enabling seamless and efficient use of various neuromorphic hardware architectures like Intel’s Loihi, IBM’s TrueNorth, or the SpiNNaker platform.

3. **Time-driven Execution**: As spiking neural networks operate in a time-dependent fashion, Converge adopts a time-driven execution model. Developers define the temporal dynamics of the system, and the language handles the intricate scheduling and simulation.

4. **Plasticity Support**: Converge includes an extensive library of learning rules and mechanisms, supporting a wide range of synaptic and neuronal plasticity models. Users can also define their own custom plasticity rules.

5. **Multi-modal Data Interaction**: Converge provides tools to easily convert and feed various types of data into neuromorphic systems. This includes traditional datasets, sensory data, or real-time streams.

6. **Simulation and Debugging Tools**: Converge includes a robust suite of tools for simulation, debugging, and performance analysis, allowing developers to rapidly prototype, test, and optimize their neuromorphic systems.

7. **Interoperability**: Converge is designed to interoperate smoothly with existing machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras. This enables developers to combine traditional neural networks with neuromorphic models in a single unified framework.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Efficiency**: High performance for neuromorphic applications.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for both small-scale and large-scale projects.
- **Robustness**: Resilient to various types of adversarial attacks.
- **Innovation in AI**: Facilitates groundbreaking research and development.
- **Interdisciplinary Integration**: Bridges the gap between neuromorphic computing and other fields.

## Sample Code 

```
neuron LIF {
    membrane_time_constant = 20 ms
    threshold_voltage = 1.0 V
}

layer Input[100] : LIF
layer Hidden[300] : LIF
layer Output[10] : LIF

connect Input -> Hidden {
    weight_distribution = Uniform(-1.0, 1.0)
    delay_distribution = Normal(1.0 ms, 0.1 ms)
    plasticity = STDP(alpha=0.1, beta=0.05, tau_plus=20 ms, tau_minus=20 ms)
}

connect Hidden -> Output {
    weight_distribution = Uniform(-1.0, 1.0)
    delay_distribution = Normal(1.0 ms, 0.1 ms)
    plasticity = STDP(alpha=0.1, beta=0.05, tau_plus=20 ms, tau_minus=20 ms)
}

pattern stimulus[100] = TimeSeries("./data/input.csv")
pattern labels[10] = TimeSeries("./data/labels.csv")

apply stimulus -> Input

train Output with labels

run for 1 s
```
While this is a rudimentary example, more complex, real-world applications would use Converge to create large-scale, interconnected networks, feed in diverse data sources, and simulate the network’s behavior over time.

## Quick Start Tutorial Guide

### Setting up the Environment

Firstly, ensure you have a compatible environment to run Converge. Check the official Converge documentation for setup and installation instructions.

### Defining Neurons

Neurons are the fundamental units of a neuromorphic system. In Converge, you define neurons with their unique properties like so:
```
neuron LIF {
    membrane_time_constant = 20 ms
    threshold_voltage = 1.0 V
}
```
This creates a layer named Input with 100 LIF neurons.

### Applying Patterns 

You can apply stimulus patterns to layers:
```
pattern stimulus[100] = TimeSeries("./data/input.csv")
apply stimulus -> Input
```

### Running The Simulation

Finally, to run the simulation:
```
run for 1 s
```
